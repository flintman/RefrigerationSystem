## Refrigeration C-PLUS-PLUS

The is my software to control a refrigeration system with a raspberry pi.

####### To Install #######
1. sudo raspi-config
    a. Enable 1-Wire, 12C, and SPI and reboot
2. install the .deb file.
3. sudo tech-tool to setup the device.

#######  On Start Up #######
On Startup the system will broadcast a hotspot to be able to connect to it.  This will last for 5 minutes unless you connect to the hotspot and then the hotspot will last
as long as you are connected.

#######  Alarm codes #######
    Shutdown Alarms
        1001 - Unit not cooling - looking for at least 5F across the coil over 30 minute  AND  Return Temp is over 30F
        1002 - Unit not heating - looking for at least 5F degrees across the coil in 30 minutes AND Retrun Temp is under 60F
        1004 - Unit Defrost timed out - Ran longer than 45 minutes in Defrost.

        2000 - Return Sensor Failure - Outside of the range
        2001 - Coil Sensor Failure - Outside of the range

        9001 - Pretrip Cooling issue
        9002 - Pretrip Heating issue
        9003 - Pretrip Cooling issue # 2

    Warning Alarms
        2002 - Supply Sensor Failure - Outside of the range


####### Demo Mode #######
Set the setpoint to 80F and press and hold the defrost button for 10 sec.  This will toggle it in and out of Demo Mode.  This will simulate cooling, heating, defrost, etc to test the equipment and see how it works.

####### PRETRIP Mode #######
Set the setpoint to 65F and press and hold the defrost button for 10 sec.  This will start pretrip mode.  This will simulate cooling, heating, and back to cooling before either alarming out or passing.
